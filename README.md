# SmithFood - Monorepo

SmithFood is an imaginary restaurant which sells the most diverse kind of food. And they're looking for maximize their profit and productivity by:
- Knowing the minimum price to sell a product to maximize demand
- Knowing the minimum stock it can produce to maximize productivity

# Solution:
By using their equation for generating a products price ***C(x)= x² + 80x + Px***
where x is the quantity of products produced and Px is the price of production of a product (in cents), we get C (its sell price in cents)
x² is the lucrativity of a product
80x is the angular coeficient to determine the demand curve
Example: ***C(x)= x² - 80x + 3000*** -> the best sell price and stock is 40 products and 1400 cents (R$ 14,00)
